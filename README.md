# Cryptanalysis-of-BORON
The file named "generate-cvc.c" could generate cvc files about different rounds.

The folder named "Result-Trails" are files which are trails with the minimal number of active S-Boxes or trails with the optimal probability/bias.

Files named "differential-active-sbox-round.cvc" are some codes about searching for differential trails with the minimal number of active S-Boxes, where "round" is the number of rounds.

Files named "differential-characteristic-round.cvc" are some codes about searching for differential trails with the optimal probability, where "round" is the number of rounds.

Files named "linear-active-sbox-round.cvc" are some codes about searching for linear trails with the minimal number of active S-Boxes, where "round" is the number of rounds.

Files named "linear-trail-round.cvc" are some codes about searching for linear trails with the optimal probability, where "round" is the number of rounds.

All numbers used in trails and codes are hexadecimal.
